# COP_3003_Integration_Project

**What is this project?**

This project will be a hybrid mobile app developed using Blazor, it will consist of a simple RPG styled game meant to serve as a demonstration of the programming concepts I have learned and of Blazor as a platform. 

**Why was this project chosen?"**

The reason why I chose this project is due to an interest in mobile and game development. I like the idea of making a project I can run with me anywhere, and which I can easily share with friends and family.

**By when will this be done?**

The project will be delivered December 15th, but as detailed in the issues page there will be different sprints November 4th and November 24th.
